# fetch-employee-details
I have .zip files on S3 which I need to download using GraphQL API created in AppSync. This repository contains downloadFiles.js which does this task. Also once downloaded, we need to unzip files and read "Basic Details" sheet from each .xlsx file. Then read specific 5 columns from each sheet and add it in single csv file.
